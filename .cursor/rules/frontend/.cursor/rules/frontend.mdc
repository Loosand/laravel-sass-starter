## Inertia.js Page Components

- Use Inertia's router for navigation
- Get backend-passed data from props
- Use usePage hook to get shared data

Reference: `resources/js/pages/samples/todos/index.tsx`

## shadcn/ui Component Usage

- Prioritize using existing shadcn/ui components in the project
- Maintain component consistency and accessibility
- Use Tailwind CSS for style customization

Reference: `resources/js/components/ui/`

## Type Safety

- Use generated TypeScript types from Laravel Data DTOs
- Generate types with: `php artisan typescript:generate`
- Generated types are located at: `resources/js/types/generated.d.ts`
- All business types are available through the global `App` type object
- Never manually write business types - always use generated types, Unless it is truly necessary
- Define interfaces only for component props and local state

Reference: `resources/js/types/generated.d.ts`, `app/Console/Commands/GenerateTypescriptTypes.php`
